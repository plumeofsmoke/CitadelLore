Tajaran are a humanoid race with feline-esque traits from Ahdomai. Hailing from Ahdomai (also referred to as Meralar), the smaller of two twin planets, they possess insulative fur and felinoid stability to better survive in their harsh native environment.



Overview

========



-   Tajaran can speak a unique language of Siik. Use this in game by

    using ,j

-   All Tajaran have claws, and will scratch with them instead of

    punching, dealing extra damage.

-   Tajaran can see much better in the dark than humans.

-   Tajaran are less vulnerable to harm from cold due to their fur, but

    more vulnerable to harm from heat.



Naming

------



Nominal characteristics vary by region and ethnicity, below are some

common styles as described with Earth-based equivalents. Bear in mind

these are not strict hard-and-fast rules, simply the “common sounds” of

each ethnicity's names; variations and exceptions do exist.



-   **Hrarar** - Commonly first name followed by family name or clan

    name. Middle names are rare. Names sound somewhat Middle-Eastern

    mixed with south-east Asian.

-   **Siik** - As above.

-   **Hakar** - As above, though middle names are more common, often as

    “honorifics” passed down through the family. Name sounds have more

    of an Icelandic bent at times as well.

-   **Selem** - Similar to the Siik. Names incorporate some

    Italian-sounding components as well.

-   **Njarir'Akhan** - First name followed by family name, suffixed by

    “enai-(Ruling House of the family)” in formal use when appropriate -

    for example, “Chii'akor Kasyir enai-Kaytam”. Elements of Japanese

    and Ancient Egyptian names.

-   **Njarjirii** - As above. Names occasionally have Spanish-sounding

    elements.

-   **Nerahni** - As above. Names also include some German elements.

-   **Siirkhani** - Two-part hyphenated first name followed by family

    name. Names sound like a mix of German and Italian.

-   **Zhan-Khazan** - Simple mono- or duo-syllable names, no real last

    names. Might provide “Zhan-Khazan” as a last name if required. Due

    to the simplistic nature of their names, there's no real Terran

    approximation to provide, only examples such as “Khal”, “Maaz”,

    “Rhem”, “Tarikh”, so on and so forth.

-   **Ur Zkan-Khazan** - As above.

-   **Shankamyan** - Completely unknown, as no communications can be

    established.

-   **Rhemazar** - First and last name, same as the Hrarar. Name sounds

    also share much in common with the Hrarar, incorporating some

    Russian-esque components as well.



Biology

-------



![](Tajaran.png "fig:Tajaran.png") Tajaran are a species of omnivorous,

bipedal mammal-analogues. Their body is covered almost entirely with a

thick fur coat, the only exceptions being the palms of their hands and

the soles of their feet and directly around their various mucous

membranes. On many individuals the fur near their neck and head grows

into a shaggy “mane”, not unlike a lion or horse's mane, which is made

of tougher, wiry hairs. Tajaran fur colors generally have a singular

color, with the mane generally being significantly darker than the rest

of the fur, though stripes and other patterns of different colors are

present among some ethnicities. The practice of dying sections of one's

fur a different color is also not unheard of. Tajaran males on average

range between 150 cm and 200 cm in height and 50 kg and 95 kg in mass.

Females are typically slightly smaller in stature.



Tajaran have two fairly large and well-developed eyes set above a

slightly elongated muzzle. Their pupils are generally large and oval

when relaxed, and contract very quickly into a horizontal aperture in

bright light. Their irises are narrow while relaxed, large when

contracted, and are most typically shades of brown, gold, green, and

rarely, blue to purple. Tajaran teeth are sharp and needle-like in the

front and slowly grow thicker towards the back. The closest analogous

tooth structure in a Terran animal is the raccoon. They do not have well

developed grinding molars and have a strong dietary preference for

meats, fats, and fruits, but are capable of eating other plants.



On the top of their head Tajarans possess two normally erect ears that

are roughly triangular and rounded. Tajaran ears have a wide range of

motion, and are capable of rotation up to ninety degrees and folding

entirely back to the skull. Because of the structure and wide range of

motion, Tajarans have a noticeably more fine range of hearing than other

crew species.



Tajaran hands and feet both have five digits and are somewhat stubby

compared to human extremities, with short claws as fingernails, similar

in shape to cashew-nuts. Tajarans are digitigrade, and most equipment

designed for humans or skrell that interacts with the legs (eg

voidsuits) requires modification to fit. All Tajarans also possess a

flexible, non-prehensile tail. This appendage is muscled and is capable

of an exceedingly large range of movement.



Tajaran have a notably longer sleep cycle than humans, the average

waking period for a Tajaran is between 30-32 hours with a subsequent

11-13 hours of sleep. This wake period is often punctuated by short

(15-30 minute) naps. Tajarans can avoid sleep for up to 75 hours without

experiencing severe negative effects in the short term, but tend to grow

lethargic and unfocused over longer periods, or if skipping sleep

regularly.



The Tajaran body is generally lithe, slender, and extremely flexible.

Sexual dimorphism in body shape between males and females is generally

slightly less distinct than in humans, though by what degree can vary

depending on ethnicity and cultural norms.



### Lifespan



The average lifespan of a Tajaran can be measured in 70 human years as

of now, but statistical predictions say it might be 90 or even 100 years

in the near future due to rapid technological advancements in the

medical field due to the conception of FTL travel and contact to other

sapient life.



Behavior

========



Relations

---------



Tajaran nations have various relationships to other extrameralan life,

mostly contained in aloof friendliness to cordial trading relationships.

Among all, the humans are regarded as the most beneficial trading

partner, considering history and dealings with the

[USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink").



Language

--------



Tajaran are capable of expressing many tones and pitches, leading to

usually very expressive languages. The myth that they incorporate body

signs into them mainly comes from the fact that Tajaran sometimes

indicate mood with their tails and ears. However, there are no such

components present in any of the main languages, only Canilunzt

incorporates body language. Tajaran speaking galactic common or human

tongues often roll and extend R sounds, which is attributed to their

accent. They can consciously avoid rolling their Rs.



### Siik



A language originating from the large Hharar agricultural communities

scattered around the Meralaran temperate zone that evolved through

trading caravans into a broad and nuanced, if complex and sometimes

unwieldy, shared language of the trading houses and the rich. For

humans, the language is difficult to speak without a great deal of

practice and experience as it incorporates a great deal of pitch

variation, yowls, and trills that are difficult to replicate with the

human palate. As a Seleminite language, they have the archetypical third

person usage to refer to themselves, often carrying over to galactic

common and other languages as the first person represents trust or

affection.



### Hakari



While lauded as the holy language, Hakari is a poor attempt to speak the

ancient Selem language, filled with bastardizations, slurrings and a

very simplified grammar. The melodious, almost fluting language is very

simple to understand, but difficult to learn. The rules are arbitrary

and have many exceptions, disregarding said rules completely for the

sake of “flow.” Native speakers get offended by foreign accents

“polluting” their “exalted tongue.” As a Seleminite language, they have

the archetypical third person usage to refer to themselves, often

carrying over to galactic common and other languages as the first person

represents trust or affection.



### Siikelem



Siikelem is the revival of the ancient Selem language, modernized and

merged with Siik grammar structures and lend words for new concepts and

objects previously not represented in old Selem. Siikelem is the best

approximation of “modernized” ancient Selem and is widely used by both

scholars and the finer society of the Third Selem Empire. It's a

language of prestige and learning it is either native by the parents or

needs to be paid with orpulent fees for those who made it their

profession to teach it. As a Seleminite language, they have the

archetypical third person usage to refer to themselves, often carrying

over to galactic common and other languages as the first person

represents trust or affection.



### Rrhangarr



Rrhangarr is mainly spoken in the harsh northern regions of Meralar, a

simple and harsh language with heavy emphasis on the R consonant and

context-based grammar. Due to the relative ease of learning it,

Rrhangarr is especially useful in trading on Meralar - although not on

the coasts, where Akhani is overwhelmingly dominant.



### Akhani



The ancient tongue of the Njarir'Akhan, dubbed Akhani. While today's

Akhani is somewhat polluted with lendwords from Siik due to its use up

and down the coasts of Meralar by the crews of trade ships, Akhani is

still a distinct language family on its own. Akhani has a very

structured and formal grammar, with words mostly formed by common

syllables and compound nouns.



Job Preference

--------------



Tajaran have no job preference one way or another, their expertise and

fields mostly dependent on their cultural background and educational

history.



Background

==========



Home World

----------



“Banded Pearl” in Old Selem. The home planet of the Tajarans in the

Rarkajar (also referred to as S'randarr) system, a terrestrial oxygen planet on the outer edge of the

Goldilocks Zone, leading to lower surface temperatures. It is rich on

resources to the point where it is theorized that the planet was

originally two and they smashed/merged together. Supporting this theory,

Meralar possesses a planetary ring of four to five layers, with no moon.

The Meralar day is about 43 hours long. The planet is sort of chilly.

There's lots of ocean, and a “tropical” belt that's roughly terran

temperate. This belt covers a band of the south of the northern

continent, and the northern coast of the southern continent (and a few

islands and atolls, of course). Between the two is the only

always-liquid portion of the planet's oceans, and it is heavily

trafficked by traders and fishing ships. There is also an eastern

continent that is relatively unexplored due to hostile natives. Much of

the northern and southern continents have subarctic climates, and there

are large polar ice caps at both poles.



Culture

-------



The Tajaran have various ethnical differences between them, sometimes

even varying from nation to nation, but they can be condensed to three.

The Hharar, the Njarir'Akhan and the Zhan-Khazan.



### Hharar



Hharar are the most numerous Tajaran ethnicity on Meralar, and were the

most heavily represented Tajarans in the diplomatic delegations that

dealt with Humans through the early post-contact years. This led to a

fairly entrenched image of the Hharar as the 'average' Tajaran among

Humans and their other interstellar neighbours. Their fur is quite

silky, long, and very thick, and usually runs between umber and pale

tan.



#### Siik



The Siik people are in many ways synonymous with the Hharar, and were

the first Hharar of Zarraya. The original Siik were migratory, but

slowly settled the southern warm belts of Zarraya with farming

communities thousands of years ago, as receding ice sheets uncovered

fertile soil and hardy plants. Siik history is filled with kingdoms,

wars, and empires - the northern Selem empires and the southern Hakar

kingdoms were and are both ruled by Siik families, although only Siik

from Zarraya still refer to themselves by the name. During the fall of

the Second Empire, most of the towns and cities held by the Selem

declared their sovereignty and dominion over their nearby lands and

became a patchwork of city-states and small kingdoms, often with uneasy

relationships with their neighbours. The Siik speak Siik - imagine that.



#### Hakar



The Hakar are the original settlers of Hakarraya, taming the lands as

per decree of the First Selem Empire and the last remnants of the

ancient realm. As the Empire fell, local governors and nobles became

petty princes and kings, deliberately muddling the true origins and

history of their people while propagating the central authority, an

all-powerful god-like emperor. The Hakar kingdoms declared war on one

another many times over the centuries after the fall of the First

Empire, aggrandizing the Old Selem Emperors as living gods and the new

kings the inheritors of their divine grace. This has led to heavily

idolized, absolute God Kings who maintain an iron-fisted rule over their

war-weary nations. Today, only a handful of Hakar Kingdoms remain, each

claiming to be led by the one true God-Emperor, entrenched in deep

rivalry with each other. Although open warfare is all but impossible,

they still try to outdo each other with huge displays of wealth and

“proof” of godhood. As a result of the earliest Siik and Njarjirii

settlers' interbreeding the Hakar are a little taller on average than

the Siik and more lightly built, sometimes described as gaunt-looking by

Zarrayans even when healthy. They speak Hakari, a bastardized version of

ancient Selem.



#### Selem



The Selem are an ancient kind of Hharar, who named themselves after the

first emperor of the Siik, Selem Hadii. Their history is long and often

bloody, having dominated the political landscape of the Siik with two

Empires for almost five hundred years. They impregnated cultural

thinking, law and military tactics of the Siik with Selem ideologies and

traditions. The decline of the Second Empire led to a bloody

interregnum, as the political vaacuum was filled with budding nation

states and invading Zhan-Khazan. This led to Zarraya's modern patchwork

of territories and borders. A successor state to the Second Empire lives

on as the Third Selem Empire, once again ruled by the Hadii. They hold

the old twin capitals of Rakari and Hekari, and make no secret of their

ambitions to re-unify the Zarrayan city-states. Selem are excessively

proud of their grandeur and pedigree, looking down on the Rhemazar and

Siik, finding them anarchistic and uncivilized. Their national language

is Siikelem, a revitalized form of ancient Selem, however most Selem

outside the inner circles of the imperial family speak Siik as at least

a second language.



### Njarir'Akhan



Njarir'Akhan are taller than the average Hharar, with narrower, more

streamlined builds and a naturally lithe musculature. Their fur is

thick, velvety, and sheds water very easily.This makes them much more at

home in the water than their continental cousins, even at higher

latitudes. Their fur is most commonly a darker, earthier variation of

the Hharar's hues. Their facial features are softer, rounder, and

shorter-muzzled than the Hharar, and their gaits are usually more

elongated and sinuous, lending them a certain predatory grace.



#### Njarjirii



The original Njarir'Akhan migrated thousands of years ago from Zarraya,

journeying across a colder Meralar's near-frozen inner sea at the end of

an ice age to settle on the Njarir Merana archipelago, where fishing was

possible in the still-liquid water. The Njarjirii are equatorial

islanders with a heavily maritime culture, centered around generosity,

individual heroism, pride, and feuds. In the past, Njarjirii were THE

Tajaran trader-explorers, and their shipping routes knitted the islands

and coastal settlements of both continents together. They are governed

by a 'House' to each island and although they feud, form, and break

alliances, they resist outside hostilities fiercely as a united front.

Njarjirii are proud of their freedom, and historically very hostile to

anything they might see as slavery as they regard personal freedom as

given. They speak Akhani.



#### Nerahni



A large house of the Njarjirii who were hired by the First Selem Empire

for their sailing expertise, at great expense, to help Hakarraya-bound

colonists cross Njarir Etari safely. Through their new wealth and

imperial ties they became the true sea traders of the Akhani. They have

some of the oldest, largest, and most elaborately ornamented ocean-going

ships on Meralar, passed down from generation to generation within each

family. Each ship is well loved and cared for, and often carved with the

names and stories of its dead crew, making the ships shrines to

themselves and their achievements. A Nerahni ship was and is often the

sole home of its families of crew, calling no port a true home -

although they often returned to distant cousin houses' islands in

Njarjirii territory for more extensive repairs and festival visits. The

Nerahni were some of the most scientifically important Tajaran of

pre-modern times, as they were responsible for much of the mathematics,

nautical navigation, and complex shipbuilding techniques in early

Meralar. They are capricious, nomadic and shrewd, considering “taking”

and “giving” being the same, as everything has a price. As first into

space, mainly as hired crew, their tradition of marking the crew's and

the vessel's history into the hull of their ships spread among Tajaran

spacefarers, making their spacefaring ships living history. They speak a

slight variation of Akhani, peppered with sailor's terms and insults.



#### Siirkhani



The Siirkhani are the descendants of the original pupils of Raniira

Merar, a prophet and divine figure of the Njarir'Akhan, who is alleged

to have led them to the bountiful islands of the ocean in a time of

need. With a rigid religious scripture which makes it impossible to

leave the cult, the Siirkhani voluntarily isolate themselves from others

and live a life of ascetics, prayer and reverence of history. In fact,

many historical records were preserved purely because of the religious

dogmas of the Siirkhani, and the efforts of their monasteries have

helped to cultivate the lands around them. Due to their beliefs they do

not marry outside their own religion, nor do they have any deeper

contact to anyone beyond cordial trading relations. Still, they are

tolerated almost everywhere, except in the lands of the Hakar, where

they are an oppressed minority.



### Zhan-Khazan



Zhan-Khazan are generally taller and stockier than even the

Njariri'Akhan. The average height is 180 cm to 225 cm, the average

weight is 70 kg to 110 kg. They have proportionally smaller eyes,

heavier jaws, and tend toward a heavily muscled build. While the hues of

the fur is often a soft white or off-colour grey, it is thick and pelty,

with heavily tufted ears.



#### "Zhan-Khazan"



Ur Zhan-Khazan who stayed true to their ways. They are raiders of the

north, nomadic and heavily reliant on ice water fishing and herding

animals. Their society is fluid and prone to sweeping changes as

Zhan-Rhezar rise and fall, tribes splinter and form. The only constant

is their lust for riches, blood and glory, which they live out on

regular raids on the Cities of the Rhemazar and Siik. They speak

Rrhangarr.



#### Shankamyan



“The Savage Tribe”, Zhan-Khazan who wandered across an ice ridge to

reach the eastern continent. They speak a local dialect which diverged

from Rrhangarr long ago. As savage as the lands they live in, the

Shankamyan are extremely territorial and agressive, making diplomacy or

even concessions completely impossible. It is rumoured that hey have

eaten the diplomants who tried. It might be true. They do not show

interest in leaving the planet. They also eat anyone who asks.



#### Rhemazar



During the chaos of the Fall of the Second Selem empire, they came.

Zhan-Khazan led by an ambitious Zhan-Rhezar Rhem descended upon the

weakened cities and warring successor kingdoms in the Northeast,

plundering, razing and killing everything in their wake. The sheer size

of the united tribe was unseen before, accumulating into the destruction

of several loyalist armies, spelling out doom upon the struggling

empire, and giving it the last push to oblivion. The tribe settled down

in the smouldering ruins they had left, first creating an uneasy

alliance with the local Hhrarar survivors and emancipated slaves. Soon,

they were assimilated, Siik tenets integrated into the Zhan-Khazan way

of life, transforming to the culture known today as Rhemazar. They live

in a relatively new Noble Federation, led by a High Prince. The only

civilized Zhan-Khazan, stoic, industrious and prone to form quick

friendships, the interbreeding with the Siik led them to be leaner and

smaller than their “wild” counterparts, although they are still

distinctively bulky. They speak a heavily polluted form of Siik with

many slang terms of Rrrhangarr present, betraying their heritage.



Religion

--------



### Story of Creation



In the beginning there was Al-Benj'rir. He is described as the driving entity that spurred the creation of the universe. Al-Benj'rir lived in the sea of S'ri, or a sea of pure energy. From this sea He created S'randarr and Messa, beings that could more finely manipulate the S'ri and objec within it. S'randarr created his island of S'ranjir, and his lantern to guide the S'ri. S'randarr was content with this however Messa had become greedy and so she tried to take more of the S'ri for herself, creating a throne of clouds. Al-Benj'rir caught wind of Messa's actions and scattered the rest of S'ri throughout the universe. From this Ahdomai and the life on it was formed. S'randarr moved S'ranjir to protect Ahdomai's S'ri. Messa now looks to make her throne of clouds a true throne, while S'randarr wishes to let the balance of S'ri guide itself, and for his sister to let the universe not be controlled, but live.

### Tajr-kii S'randarr



A fairly old and well-known religious sect on Meralar, the teachings of

Tajr-kii S'randarr (roughly translated as “We who follow S'randarr”)

pervade almost every aspect of modern Selem culture, from sun motifs in

paintings to turns of phrase referring to “the Light”. It is less

commonly worshipped among the Siik and Rhemazar, and even more rarely

among the Hakar due to their focus on the God Kings, but exceptions

exist as with all things.



The Tajr-kii hold that S'randarr and Messa are locked in eternal battle

over the fate of the dead. When someone dies, the soul travels to

Messa's realm, known as \*The Bounty\*. The Bounty is said to be a

desolate wasteland of eternal wind and fire, where souls are drained of

energy to fuel Messa and reduced to dark, mindless husks, before

eventually fading into nothingness. The hope is that S'randarr's

ever-watchful Eye can locate the soul before it is drained, and can be

lifted from the Bounty to be safely stored within S'randarr Himself via the

process is known as Ascension.



There, the soul melds with the network of other souls stored there,

gaining vast knowledge stretching back to the very beginnings of the

Tajaran species. Some souls are even said to act as mouthpieces for

S'randarr, their whispers reaching the ears of the devout to lend

guidance or consolation.



S'randarr does not imprison them, however. If at any point a soul wishes

to leave, they are taken to a place called \*That Which Comes After\*,

which is said to be a large floating island of light with a door in the

center. When the soul steps through the door, it is reincarnated within

an unborn child to experience life once more. The child is said to

retain certain traits from its soul's previous incarnations, and every

incarnation allows the soul itself to grow in power. As such, souls that

have been through many reincarnations - so-called “old souls” - are

especially valuable to Messa, and therefore S'randarr must be doubly

determined to locate these old souls so they cannot fuel Messa's

powers.



However, S'randarr's failing is that He is unchanging. While He is vastly

stronger than Messa in direct confrontation, Her ability to change and

grow allows Her to best Him with indirect methods, such as the

aforementioned redirecting the dead to Her realm so She can siphon their

power.


### Tajr-kii Messa



A similarly old yet almost completely despised religious sect on Meralar, 

the teachings of Tajr-kii Messa (roughly translated as "We who follow Messa). 

Often viewed as the polar opposite to those who follow S'randarr. There are

two main principles of Tajr-kii Messa, everything is a cycle of death that 

should not be broken, and embrace change in any form it may come in. The end

goal of life is to bring as much to Messa as one can when they die, via the

process known as Assimilation. Another core behavior principle is to act in

the moment and on impulse. 



Followers of Tajr-kii Messa believe in many of the same things that those 

who practice Tajr-kii S'randarr do, but choose to worship Messa rather 

than S'randarr. Death is more freely accepted to be able to become one with

Messa, and assist her in her eternal battle with S'randarr. Anything that can

lead to more of that such as a larger population that will offer more souls, is a

focus, and desired by those who follow Messa. Followers will wish to grow in 

knowledge and enrich their soul with that knowledge, so that Messa may have that

much more power over S'randarr.



Those who follow Messa are highly against cloning, as it does not promote change,

prevents the cycle of death, and clings to the old ways. This process may be means

by which to pull one's soul back from The Bounty, depriving Messa of more energy.

Cyborgification would be preferable as it offers a change of shell the soul is in.

Medical treatment is still allowed with this, but if it were to cause a major

change physically it should be embraced. As such, the use of prosthetic replacements

to limbs and organs would be rather frowned upon, but not restricted, due to some

extent of change involved with an attempt to hold old form. The preferable option

would be to leave a limb lost.



It is widely believed by those who follow either Messa or S'randarr that She 

controls death. When she wishes to feast on souls of the living she will influence 

the world to bring about death, so that their souls may come to the Bounty for her 

to feast on. This could come in the form of natural disasters, or influences on those 

living in the mortal, who are cut off from S'randarr's wisdom and assistance. Injuries 

caused from natural disasters are seen as Messa attempting to "taste" one's soul.



### Holidays



Followers of S'randarr celebrate Taji-kiar Ajarr (roughly translated as "Those who 

Ascend) which is a holiday practiced at the dawn of the equivalent of spring time 

on Meralar. It has symbolic meaning of souls freed from Messa and The Bounty, 

symbolized by the passing of Winter, returning to life to begin their cycle again. 

For those who have lost parts of their family during this time, this is a time of 

public mourning and recognition of those souls, and prayers to S'randarr for their 

rescue from Messa. It is believed that these focused thoughts help S'randarr find 

those lost souls, the thoughs of the living guiding His way.



Followers of Messa have no official holidays due to it's widespread discrimination

and numerous attempts at extermination. There is however, some emphasis on the

celebration of the change of seasons, and seasonal cycles. The best time for

celebration is the time between the equivalent of falll and winter, to symbolize

Messa taking life from Meralar, and furthering her power from that.
